# Calendar-library-application

## Description

Calendar library application is an application designed to save events to a calendar for the average work day, or the hours 9 am through 5 pm, in order to help organize the user's events. The calendar users color to indicate whether events scheduled on the calendar are in the past, present, or future, so that the user has visual cues to know whether or not an event is happening within the hour. Building this application helped me to understand jQuery's (this).

## Installation

Application is installed and running. No steps are needed to install properly.

## Usage

To store information in the calendar, type the event into the text box of the corresponding hour and hit the save button. Examples are included in screenshot 1: ![events scheduled during 11AM inside the calendar](images/Screenshot-1.jpg)

The current time, displayed as 3:44 PM, shows how the color coordination of the time blocks indicate past/gray, present/blue, and future/green, included in screenshot 2: ![color coordination of time blocks](images/Screenshot-2.jpg)
